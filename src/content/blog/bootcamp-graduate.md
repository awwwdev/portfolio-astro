Are you just graduated from a web development bootcamp?

Congratulation!

So far you learned the basic topics, which will get you started. But what you will face 20x more topics! And there is no learning plan laid out for you. You are on your own. Welcome to the tutorial hell.

This was how it went for me. But it can be better for you. That's why I creating a in-depth Learning Map that I will release soon. But in the mean time I don't want to leave you empty handed.

So here is a quick list of amazing learning resources I found through my "tutorial hell" journey!

And one quick advice. Don't be to picky to find the best learning resources in any specific topic. As a developer you eventually learn things that don't use much. Be ok with this. Don't wait for the perfect learning path. Just get Started.

Ok. Enough talking. Here is the list, sectioned by media types.
