  <p>
    I help businesses to discover their visual language, create wireframes, make high fidelity UI prototypes and develop
    it into production.
  </p>

  <p>During past 7 years, I have worked with many teams as a Designer, Developer or both.</p>

  <p>
    My experinces are most beneficial to competitons who want to stand apart from the competition, by delivering
    astonishing User Interfaces, but don't want to comprimise performance, accessiblity and development speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides work, I spend my time with illustrating, Photography and Music. I'd love to explore areas that combine Art and Web Technologies together!
